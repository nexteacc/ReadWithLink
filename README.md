# ReadWithLink Privacy Policy

## Introduction

ReadWithLink is a browser extension designed to enhance the web reading experience. We are committed to protecting user privacy and safeguarding user data. This privacy policy outlines how we handle information related to this extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Information We Collect

ReadWithLink does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. The extension only processes the content of the current active tab when explicitly activated by the user.

### How We Use Information

When reading mode is activated, the extension:

1. Uses the Readability library to parse the current page content.
2. Temporarily modifies the page DOM to create an optimized reading view.
3. Extracts and displays relevant links from the page.

All these operations are performed locally in the user's browser, and no data is sent to external servers.

## Data Storage

ReadWithLink does not permanently store any user data or browsing history. The page is restored to its original state when exiting reading mode.

## Permission Usage

This extension requests the following permissions, used solely for implementing its core functionality:

- `activeTab`: Allows the extension to access the content of the current active tab.
- `tabs`: Used to detect tab loading status and execute content scripts.

## Third-Party Services

ReadWithLink does not use any third-party analytics tools or services. All functionality is executed locally without external data transfer.

## Updates

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be communicated to users through the GitHub repository or extension update channels.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this privacy policy, please contact us through the Issues feature of our GitHub repository.
